## Simple To-Do List with React and Bootstrap

First time ever using React/front-end framework; just followed a tutorial on YouTube. 
I'm also very inexperienced on web dev, like I don't know most of the DOM API.

Notes of what I learned:
- `localStorage` stores small amounts of data; no need for databases for applications like these
- React uses hooks that update content on your page
    - `useEffect` updates content every single time something changes (unless specified by property array)
    - `useRef` keeps a reference of content as it updates
    - `useState` basically "creates" a new object that it keeps track of
- Need to `export-default-function` every single time you want to make a new JSX thing
